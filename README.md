# Call-for-Code-Protecting-our-Environment-Challenge-Accelerator
A Sustainable Solution for Protecting Environment 

Approximately one million well hand pumps are installed across Africa. 
While they are relatively sturdy and easy to maintain, it is estimated that one-third of 
these pumps are out of service at any given time, leaving entire communities 
without reliable access to water. Some communities also face declining groundwater supplies. 

Americares, a global health-focused nonprofit organization, is partnering with these communities. 
Using publicly available data, you are asked to develop a solution that either: 

- analyzes potential hand pump failure modes 
- guides users on steps to take to repair the hand pumps 
- assesses the long-term risks to groundwater supply
